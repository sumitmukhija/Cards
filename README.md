# Cards
Swift application that parses JSON from a dropbox hosted file to provide general awareness, primarily built for competitive exams

The main idea is to provide a click & ad-free environment to students preparing for general awareness. The program uses a JSON file that needs to be updated regularly.<br>I am currently using content from AffairsCloud.com.
